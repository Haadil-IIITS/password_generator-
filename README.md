🔐 PyPassword Generator
A secure, completely random password generator built with Python. This tool allows users to generate strong passwords with a customized mix of letters, numbers, and symbols to improve digital security.

📖 Description
This program generates a unique password based on user input. Unlike simple generators that might put all letters first and numbers last (e.g., abc123!), this program uses a shuffling algorithm to completely randomize the character order (e.g., 1b!a3c), making the password significantly harder to crack.

I built this project to practice:

The random module (choice and shuffle).

Python Lists vs Strings: Converting strings to lists to manipulate mutable data.

Loops: Iterating through ranges to build data.

User Input: Handling integers for customization.

⚡ Features
Customizable Length: You decide exactly how many letters, symbols, and numbers you want.

Strong Security: Includes special characters (!, #, $, etc.) and numbers.

Randomized Order: Uses random.shuffle() to ensure characters are not predictable by type.

🎮 How to Use
Run the script.

Enter the number of Letters you want.

Enter the number of Symbols.

Enter the number of Numbers.

Copy your new secure password!

💡 Potential Upgrade
Right now, your code prints the password to the screen. A cool "Next Step" for this project would be to make it automatically copy the password to your clipboard so you can paste it immediately.
